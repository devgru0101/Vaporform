## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create project structure
   mkdir vaporform
   cd vaporform
   
   # Initialize backend
   mkdir backend frontend infrastructure docs
   cd backend
   npm init -y
   npm install encore.dev @anthropic-ai/sdk
   
   # Set up infrastructure
   cd ../infrastructure
   docker-compose init
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Repository Structure**
   ```
   vaporform/
   ├── backend/                 # Encore.ts backend services
   ├── frontend/               # Modified VSCode frontend
   ├── infrastructure/         # Docker, Terraform, K8s configs
   ├── shared/                # Shared types and utilities
   ├── docs/                  # Documentation

   ```

3. **Development Environment**
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.dev.yml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     postgres:
       image: postgres:15
       environment:
         POSTGRES_DB: vaporform_dev
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev_password
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     
     redis:
       image: redis:7
       ports:
         - "6379:6379"
     
     traefik:
       image: traefik:v2.10
       command:
         - --api.insecure=true
         - --providers.docker=true
       ports:
         - "80:80"
         - "8080:8080"
   ```

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Backend → Container Management**: Core backend must be stable before container orchestration
2. **Container Management → Frontend**: Frontend needs working container API
3. **Frontend → Claude Integration**: UI components needed before AI integration
4. **Claude Integration → Project Wizard**: AI capabilities required for intelligent project creation
5. **All Core Features → Production Deployment**: Everything must work before production

### Resource Allocation Recommendations

#### Team Structure (Recommended)
- **Backend Developer** (1-2): Encore.ts services, Claude integration
- **Frontend Developer** (1-2): VSCode modification, UI components
- **Infrastructure Engineer** (1): Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Full-Stack Developer** (1): Integration work, testing
- **DevOps Engineer** (0.5): CI/CD, monitoring, deployment

#### Technology Decisions Made
- **Backend**: Encore.ts (provides infrastructure automation)
- **Frontend**: Modified VSCode (maintains extension compatibility)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (reliable, feature-rich)
- **Container**: Docker (industry standard)
- **Orchestration**: Terraform + Traefik (infrastructure as code)
- **AI**: Claude Code SDK (advanced code generation)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **VSCode Modification Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex codebase modification
   - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal changes, gradual feature addition
   - **Fallback**: Use VSCode as iframe with postMessage API

2. **Claude API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk**: API quotas limiting functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent caching, request batching
   - **Fallback**: Local AI models for basic operations

3. **Container Security**
   - **Risk**: User code execution security
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive sandboxing, resource limits
   - **Fallback**: Remote container execution

### Business Risks
1. **Development Timeline**
   - **Risk**: Feature creep, complexity underestimation
   - **Mitigation**: Strict MVP scope, phased releases
   - **Fallback**: Reduce initial feature set

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - **Risk**: System performance under load
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, scalable architecture
   - **Fallback**: Horizontal scaling, caching layers
