# Vaporform Architecture Implementation Summary

## Architecture Agent Deliverables

As the Architecture Agent in the Vaporform multi-agent development system, I have successfully designed and implemented the detailed system architecture building upon the solid foundation established by the Research Agent.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Delivered

### 1. Extended Backend Microservices

- Resource allocation and monitoring (CPU, memory, storage limits)
- Port management with automatic allocation
- Health checking and performance metrics
- Volume mounting for project file integration
- Container logs and real-time statistics

#### **File System Service** (`/backend/src/services/filesystem.ts`)
- Virtual file system with database-backed metadata
- Complete version control for all file changes
- Real-time file synchronization with containers
- Advanced search capabilities (content and filename)
- File operations (copy, move, rename, delete)
- Permission management and access control
- File annotations and collaborative commenting
- Diff generation between file versions

#### **WebSocket Service** (`/backend/src/services/websocket.ts`)
- Real-time collaboration sessions
- Operational Transform for conflict-free concurrent editing
- Live cursor tracking and selection sharing
- In-session chat functionality
- Presence awareness and user status
- Connection management and heartbeat monitoring
- Event broadcasting and state synchronization

### 2. Comprehensive Database Schema

Extended the existing PostgreSQL schema (`/infrastructure/database/init.sql`) with:

#### **Container Management Tables**
- `containers` - Container metadata and configuration
- `container_ports` - Port allocation tracking
- `container_logs` - Container log storage
- `container_metrics` - Performance metrics history

- `virtual_files` - File metadata and content
- `file_versions` - Complete version history
- `file_annotations` - Collaborative comments and todos

#### **Real-time Collaboration Tables**
- `collaboration_sessions` - Active collaboration sessions
- `session_participants` - Session membership and roles
- `websocket_connections` - Active WebSocket connections
- `cursor_positions` - Real-time cursor tracking
- `text_selections` - Selection range sharing
- `operational_transforms` - Edit operation history
- `chat_messages` - In-session chat history

### 3. Type-Safe Shared Interfaces
